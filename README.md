A personalized browser extension that displays widgets when pressed. The extension features a calendar, weather, bible, news, light, and stocks widget that can be moved around in a customized order.

To install: First put all of these files in a folder. Then navigate to the extensions tab in your browser and press the load unpacked button. Select this folder and it should install automatically.
